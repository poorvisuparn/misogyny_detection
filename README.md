# Misogyny Detection

## Description
This is an NLP project that can detect misogyny (i.e. derogatory comments aimed at women) in sentences. <br/>
It includes multiple cleaning and tokenisation methods, and uses GloVe model for vectorisation and BERT model to classify the statements as misogynistic or not.<br/>

## Setup
The project is built on a kaggle notebook with the input data being the following:<br />
Download the GloVe model scraped from twitter through the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bertcarremans/glovetwitter27b100dtxt  (file name: glove.twitter.27B.100d.txt) <br /> 
Upload the Sexism annotated data csv file onto the environment: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pes2ug20cs532/sexism (file name: sexism_data.csv) <br />
The notebook can be run in a regular python environment.
